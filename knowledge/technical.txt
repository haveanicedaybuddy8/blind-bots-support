TECHNICAL INSTALLATION GUIDE

OVERVIEW
To install the AI Sales Assistant, you must inject a specific Javascript snippet into the global footer of your website. This ensures the chat widget appears on every page and functions correctly across your entire domain.

THE CODE SNIPPET
Copy the following line of code exactly. Replace "YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY" with the key provided in your dashboard.

<script src="https://blind-bot-server.onrender.com/widget.js" data-api-key="YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY" async></script>

*** CRITICAL: SITEWIDE ADOPTION ***
For the bot to work effectively, this code must be active on your ENTIRE DOMAIN (e.g., www.yourblindstore.com), not just a specific landing page or subdomain.
- Why? If a customer navigates from your "Home" page to your "Gallery" page, the chat session must persist. If the code is missing on the Gallery page, the chat will disappear, and the lead may be lost.
- Action: Always place the code in a "Global" footer or header setting that applies to every single page automatically.
